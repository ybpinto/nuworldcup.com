				<p class="section-text">Since its inception in 2010, NU World Cup has been bringing the Northwestern community together through the shared love for the game of soccer. Working towards an even more inclusive and diverse NU family, we organize events throughout the year to help our philanthropy and promote our main event - the Northwestern World Cup.</p>
				<img src="img/germanylogo.jpg" id="germany-logo" class="inline-img inline-logo">
				<p class="section-text">Throughout the year, our six committees put together events such as the FIFA and Futsal tournaments, Human Foosball and fundraisers for our philanthropy. </p>			
				<p class="section-text">The Northwestern World Cup is a 3-day event, based on the format of the actual FIFA World Cup, organized at the Lakeside Field. With 32 teams and over 500 participating players, Northwestern World Cup is the largest student run athletic event on Northwesternâ€™s campus.</p>
				<p class="section-text">Initially starting off as ISA World Cup in 2010, NU World Cup has been an independent organization since 2012. At the end of just our first year as an organization, we received the 2013 Wildcat Excellence Award for Outstanding Undergraduate Student Organization.</p>
				<img src="img/brazillogo.jpg" id="brazil-logo" class="inline-img inline-logo">			
				<p class="section-text">As we continue to grow and expand each year, we strive for an even more united Northwestern community. None of this would be possible without our committee members, sponsors and members of the Northwestern community who have all given NU World Cup the love and support to transform us into the organization we are today!</p>
